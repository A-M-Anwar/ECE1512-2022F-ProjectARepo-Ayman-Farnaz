# ECE1512-2022 Digital Image Processing Course

This repo includes the implementation of two projects as a part of a group work for the course ECE1512-2022 Digital Image Processing Course at the electrical Engineering Department UofT.

* The first [Project A](./Project%20A/) project is to apply Knowledge Distillation using different deep learning model on two datasets for two dataset MNIST and MHIST datasets.  The project requirements are:
    1. Use the given CNN and MLP in the project statement and use Knowledge Distillation to transfer the knowledge form the CNN model to th MLP model.
    2. Compare between the models using the performance measures, model generalization and number of floating point operations.
    3. Use the popular ResNet50 and MobiLeNet50 to transfer the knowledge of learning the unbalanced MHIST dataset.
* The second  [Project B](./Project%20B/) project is to apply Dataset Distillation using different deep learning model on two datasets MNIST and CIFAR10.  Tis project is divided into three parts in each part we implemented different DD paper
    1. We implemented the `Dataset Condensation using Gradient matching` on both datasets and compared the performance measures of the testing data using the original and synthetic datasets.
    2. We implemented the `Dataset Condensation using Distribution Matching` on both datasets and compared the performance measures of the testing data using the original and synthetic datasets.
    3. We implemented the `Dataset Condensation By Matching Training Trajectories` on both datasets and compared the performance measures of the testing data using the original and synthetic datasets.
