##### Solutions
1.  Read the paper “Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network” [6] carefully, and then answer the following questions: [2.5 Marks]
    * What is the purpose of using KD in this paper? 
    * In the paper, what knowledge is transferred from the teacher model to the student model?
    * What is the temperature hyperparameter T ? Why do we use it when transferring knowledgefrom one model to another? What effect does the temperature hyperparameter have in KD?
    * Explain in detail the loss functions on which the teacher and student model are trained in this paper. How does the task balance parameter affect student learning? 
    * Can we look at the KD as a regularization technique, here? Explain your rationale.
